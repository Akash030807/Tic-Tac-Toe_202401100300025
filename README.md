The Tic-Tac-Toe Solver is an AI-driven program that plays the game optimally using the Minimax algorithm. It evaluates all possible moves to choose the best one, ensuring it never loses. The solver checks for a winner or a draw after each move. A human player can compete against the AI, which responds intelligently.
